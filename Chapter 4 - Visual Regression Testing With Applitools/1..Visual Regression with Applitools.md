# Visual Regression Testing With Applitools

## Understanding Visual Testing:
Visual testing is used to ensure that the appearance of an application is as expected. It goes beyond functional testing by checking the UI for any unintended visual changes.

This is important for catching issues that might not affect functionality but still impact the user experience, such as layout shifts or color changes.

## Introduction to Applitools:

Applitools is a tool that specializes in visual regression testing. It integrates with Playwright to automate visual checks and manage baselines (reference images for comparison).

Applitools offers advanced features like ignoring certain areas of an image, setting the precision level for comparisons, and managing different environments and devices.

## Implementing Visual Regression Tests:
You can implement visual regression tests in Playwright using Applitools by setting up your test environment, installing the Applitools SDK, and configuring tests to take and compare screenshots.

## Using Different Test Runners:
Applitools provides two main runners:
- **Ultrafast Grid**: Executes tests in the cloud, handling multiple browsers and devices in parallel, which is ideal for large-scale testing.
- **Classic Runner**: Runs tests locally on individual machines, requiring more manual setup and management.
